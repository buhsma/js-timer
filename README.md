# js-timer

- Stopwatch
- Timer
- Analog clock
- Minimum width: 400px (Danke, Chris)

## Improvements

- JavaScript code is not well-structured and redundant in many places. Limited time to fix. Some concerns that it might stop working if I try.
- Design is very basic. I'm not a designer.
- Missing comments. Some functions are not self-explanatory and would need a description.

### Achievements

I'm happy with my features. I implemented everything I planned and then some.
